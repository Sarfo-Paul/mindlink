# MindLink

> **A private, AI-assisted mental health triage system that helps individuals detect risk early and connects them to the right support — even without internet access.**

MindLink is a stigma-free mental health entry point built for a health hackathon. It uses AI-driven risk detection, cognitive mini-games, and a structured escalation pathway to identify early warning signs and guide users toward care — without diagnosing or replacing professionals.

## How It Works

```
User (USSD / Web)
        ↓
Daily Check-ins (mood, sleep, stress, energy, social)
+ Cognitive Game Signals (memory, attention, reaction time)
+ Behavioral Signals (missed check-ins, engagement gaps)
        ↓
AI Risk Detection Engine
        ↓
Risk Classification  🟢 Stable  🟡 At Risk  🔴 High Risk
        ↓

## AI Risk Detection Engine

The core of MindLink. Located in `server/src/services/triageEngine.ts`.

Every check-in triggers a multi-signal pipeline:

### 1. Daily Score (0–100)

Weighted combination of the five check-in inputs:

| Signal            | Weight | Notes                                 |
| ----------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Mood              | 25%    | 1–5 scale                             |
| Stress            | 20%    | Inverted (high stress = lower score)  |
| Sleep             | 20%    | 1–5 scale                             |
| Energy            | 20%    | 1–5 scale                             |
| Social connection | 15%    | Binary: isolated (1) or connected (5) |

### 2. Trend Detection

Linear regression over the last 10 check-ins. A slope below −3 points/day is flagged as a declining trend.

### 3. Behavioral Signals

- **`daysSinceLastCheckin`** — gaps of 3+ days raise a flag; 5+ days with low score escalates to RED
- **`missedDaysInLastWeek`** — 4+ missed days in a 7-day window triggers a yellow flag

### 4. Cognitive Signals

Compared across the last 2 game sessions:

- Accuracy drop > 20% (and current accuracy < 60%) → cognitive penalty
- Duration increase > 1.5× previous → cognitive penalty

### 5. Calibration-Aware Confidence

| Check-ins | Confidence | Baseline checks               |
| --------- | ---------- | ----------------------------- |
| < 3       | LOW        | Disabled (not enough history) |
| 3–4       | MEDIUM     | Only extreme drops (>40 pts)  |
| ≥ 5       | HIGH       | Full checks                   |

This prevents false positives for new users.

### Risk Output

```typescript
{
  level: 'GREEN' | 'YELLOW' | 'RED',
  explanation: string,   // Human-readable, e.g. "consistent declining trend over 8 days"
  confidenceLevel: 'LOW' | 'MEDIUM' | 'HIGH'
}
```

## Cognitive Games

Games act as **passive assessment tools**, not entertainment. Results feed directly into the risk engine.

| Game             | Measures                              | MMSE Formula                                                     |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Guess What**   | Visual memory, recall depth           | Log-weighted accuracy + response time, normalized to 0–30        |
| **Stroop**       | Executive function, cognitive control | 55% accuracy + 30% speed + 15% error penalty, normalized to 0–30 |
| **Memory Match** | Working memory (dashboard mini-game)  | Score + accuracy + mistakes stored to DB                         |

---

## Escalation Pathway

1. **In-app alert** — `RiskAlertModal` appears post-check-in for YELLOW/RED. Options: connect to counsellor, talk to AI, crisis helpline (RED only).
2. **AI Chatbot** — keyword-aware + risk-context responses. Escalates to human referral when RED + negative language detected.
3. **One-click support request** — creates an open `SupportRequest` record in the DB.
4. **Practitioner triage queue** — role-protected dashboard sorted by risk severity (RED → YELLOW → GREEN). Assign, review case history, resolve.
5. **Professional scheduling** — browse support network (real DB users + mock professionals), pick a time slot, generate a Meet link.

## What MindLink Is Not

MindLink does **not** diagnose mental illness or replace therapists. It triages and guides — detecting early risk patterns and connecting users to appropriate human support.
